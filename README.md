# Student Guide: Accessing the Training Environment
## 1. Create Your Personal Copy (Forking)
Before opening the code, you need to create your own version of the repository so you can save your work.

- Navigate to the GitHub link provided by your instructor.
- In the top-right corner of the page, click the Fork button.
- Click Create Fork. You now have a copy of the materials under your own GitHub account.

2. Launching the Codespace
Now that you have your own copy, you can start the cloud environment.

- Inside your forked repository, click the green <> Code button.
- Select the Codespaces tab.
- Click Create codespace on main.
- Wait a few moments for the environment to build. You will eventually see a version of Visual Studio Code right in your browser.

3. Saving Your Notes and Materials
A Codespace is "persistent," meaning if you close the tab, your files stay there. However, to ensure your work is backed up to your GitHub profile, you must Commit and Push your changes:

- Create/Edit files: Add your notes or complete the exercises in the explorer on the left.
- Open Source Control: Click the icon that looks like a branching path (or press Ctrl+Shift+G).
- Stage Changes: Click the + (plus) icon next to the files you've changed.
- Commit: Type a short message (e.g., "Added notes for Day 1") in the box and click Commit.
- Push: Click Sync Changes to upload your notes to your GitHub repository.

Pro Tip: If you stop working, the Codespace will eventually "suspend" itself to save your free hours. You can always restart it by going to github.com/codespaces.
